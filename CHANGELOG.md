# Changelog

All Notable changes to `laraflock/multi-tenant` will be documented in this file

### 0.7.3 (beta 3)

Stabilization completed, the added installer script helps on proving this point.

### 0.6.0 (beta 2)

Testing completed, the webserver dependancy is not yet stable.

### 0.5.3

The changelog has been hardly updated since 0.4.3; my apologies for this. My goal has been to stabilize
the package and to guarantee it can be deployed in working order. This goal will remain until the first
stable release 1.0.0. At this time the tests all point out the package works, but not all code nor
all integration testing has been completely written.

### 0.4.3

- Moved to permanent namespace Laraflock.

### 0.4.2

- Preliminary release now available, let's call this a _Release Candidate 1_
- Migration to LaraLeague complete, fixed [readme.md](readme.md) and unit test in travis

### 0.4.1

- Namespace changed to LaraLeague
- Fixed tenant migrations and unit tests to validate that functionality

### 0.4.0

- Basic implemenation of migrating for all or separate tenants.

### 0.3.1

- General system now works, supports multi tenancy globally for Laravel 5.1 LTS.
